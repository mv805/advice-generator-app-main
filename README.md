## My process

### Built with

- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Advice API
- Javascript
- Mobile First Design

### What I learned

I had some fun working with this API and creating a responsive widget with funny quotes that update at the user command. I was able to build the whole page and all elements in Javascript without any hard coding HTML of the body element. 

I was able to manipulate the page with a media query to ensure smooth mobile first responsive design.
